# hand-gesture-recognition
ABSTRACT 

Communication plays a vital part in mortal life. It encourages a man to pass on 
his sentiments, passions and dispatches by talking, composing or by exercising 
some other medium. Hand Gesture grounded communication is the main 
system for Communication for the converse and hail weakened individualities. 
Communication via gestures is a shoptalk that utilizations outwardly 
transmitted movements that consolidates hand signs and development of the 
hand. subscribe language is the only tool of communication for the person who 
isn't suitable speak and hear anything. The design aims at erecting a machine 
literacy model that will be suitable to classify and fete the colorful hand 
gestures used for fingerspelling in sign language. In this stoner independent 
model, bracket machine literacy algorithms are trained and tested to fete 
different hand gestures. But rather of using high- end technology like gloves or 
kinect, we aim to break this problem using state of the art computer vision and 
machine literacy algorithms. With recent advances in deep literacy and 
computer vision there has been promising progress in the fields of stir and 
gesture recognition using deep literacy and computer vision- grounded ways. 
The proposed model takes videotape excerpts temporal and spatial features 
from them. We also use Inception, a CNN( Convolutional Neural Network) for 
feting spatial features. But instead of using high-end technology like gloves or 
kinect , we aim to solve this problem using state of the art computer vision and 
machine learning algorithms. With recent advances in deep learning and 
computer vision there has been promising progress in the fields of motion and 
gesture recognition using deep learning and computer vision-based techniques. 
The proposed model takes video extracts temporal and spatial features from 
them. We then use Inception, a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) for 
recognizing spatial features.

INTRODUCTION

Communication is very crucial to human beings, as it 
enables us to express ourselves. We communicate through 
speech, gestures, body language, reading, writing or through 
visual aids, speech being one of the most commonly used 
among them. However, unfortunately, for the speaking and 
hearing impaired minority, there is a communication gap. 
Visual aids, or an interpreter, are used for communicating with 
them. However, these methods are rather cumbersome and 
expensive, and can't be used in an emergency. Sign Language 
chiefly uses manual communication to convey meaning. This 
involves simultaneously combining hand shapes, orientations 
and movement of the hands, arms or body to express the 
speaker's thoughts. 
 Sign Language consists of fingerspelling, which spells out 
words character by character, and word level association which 
involves hand gestures that convey the word meaning. 
Fingerspelling is a vital tool in sign language, as it enables the 
communication of names, addresses and other words that do 
not carry a meaning in word level association. In spite of this, 
fingerspelling is not widely used as it is challenging to 
understand and difficult to use. Moreover, there is no universal 
sign language and very few people know it, which makes it an 
inadequate alternative for communication. 
 A system for sign language recognition that classifies 
finger spelling can solve this problem. Various machine 
learning algorithms are used and their accuracies are recorded 
and compared in this report.

TECH STACK

OpenCV 
 
OpenCV is the library we will be using for image 
transformation functions such as converting the image to 
grayscale. It is an open-source library and can be used for many 
image functions and has a wide variety of algorithm 
implementations. C++ and Python are the languages supported 
by OpenCV. It is a complete package which can be used with 
other libraries to form a pipeline for any image extraction or 
detection framework. The range of functions it supports is 
enormous, and it also includes algorithms to extract feature 
descriptors. 

Python

 Python is a powerful scripting language and is very 
useful for solving statistical problems involving machine 
learning algorithms. It has various utility functions which help in 
preprocessing. Processing is fast and it is supported on almost all 
platforms. Integration with C++ and other image libraries is very 
easy, and it has in-built functions and libraries to store and 
manipulate data of all types. It provides the pandas and numpy 
framework which helps in manipulation of data as per our need. 
A good feature set can be created using the numpy arrays which 
can have n-dimensional data. 

Media Pipe

Media Pipe is a customizable machine learning 
solutions framework developed by Google. It is an open-source 
and cross-platform framework, and it is very lightweight. Media 
Pipe comes with some pre-trained ML solutions such as face 
detection, pose estimation, hand recognition, object detection, 
etc. It consists of multiple datasets embedded in itself. 

Spyder

Spyder is a powerful scientific environment written in 
Python, for Python, and designed by and for scientists, engineers 
and data analysts. It features a unique combination of the 
advanced editing, analysis, debugging and profiling functionality 
of a comprehensive development tool with the data exploration, 
interactive execution, deep inspection and beautiful visualization 
capabilities of a scientific package. Furthermore, Spyder offers 
built-in integration with many popular scientific packages, 
including NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, IPython, QtConsole, 
Matplotlib, SymPy, and more.n Beyond its many built-in 
features, Spyder can be extended even further via third-party 
plugins. Spyder can also be used as a PyQt5 extension library, 
allowing you to build upon its functionality and embed its 
components, such as the interactive console or advanced editor, 
in your own software.
